# start_follow_read_py3

This repository is the implementation of the methods described in the paper [Start, Follow, Read: Full-Page End-to-end Handwriting Recognition](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Curtis_Wigington_Start_Follow_Read_ECCV_2018_paper.html). The code is heavily based on the original code as released by the authors. Our repository has some minor changes to make it run with python3 and pytorch=1.3.


## Dependencies

The dependencies are all found in `sfr_env_environment.yaml`. They are installed as follows.
```
conda env create -f sfr_env_environment.yaml
```

The environment is activated as `source activate sfr_env`.


## Running the code
All steps to run the code are same as in official code released at
https://github.com/cwig/start_follow_read
